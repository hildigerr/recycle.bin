.TH RECYCLE 1 "March 2025" "Version 1.0" "Recycle Script Manual"

.SH NAME
recycle \- move files to a recycle bin directory with Git tracking

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B recycle
[\fIoptions\fR] <file1> <file2> ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBrecycle\fR script moves specified files into a designated recycle bin directory while tracking changes using Git. It is designed for preserving temporary or one-time-use files that may be useful later.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-m\fR "message"
Specify a custom commit message for Git. If not provided, a default message will be generated using the current date and time. The list of files is always included in the commit message body.

.TP
.B \-b=\fIbranchname\fR
Switch to the specified branch named \fIbranchname\fR in the recycle bin repository before recycling any files. If the branch does not exist, it will be created based on the \fImaster\fR branch. The specified branch will remain active after the operation. If this option is not used, the currently active branch will be used.

.TP
.B \-cp=\fIhash_of_commit\fR
Copy the recycled files from a specified commit into the active branch. This option allows you to cherry-pick commits from another branch into your current branch. It is particularly useful for maintaining a clean installation by copying commits from other branches (e.g., from an upstream repository) and then removing the original branch if desired.

.SH USAGE EXAMPLES
.TP
Recycle a single file:
.B recycle /path/to/file.txt

.TP
Recycle multiple files with a custom commit message:
.B recycle -m \(dqscraped example.com\(dq /path/to/scrape_example.sh /path/to/post_process_example.sh


.TP
Recycle multiple files with the default commit message:
.B recycle /path/to/file1.txt /path/to/file2.txt

.TP
Initialize a new personal branch:
.B recycle -b=$USER

.TP
Recycle files into a private branch:
.B recycle -b=private /path/to/sensitive/file1.txt /path/to/unshared/file2.txt

.TP
Switch to a personal branch and copy the specified commit into it. This allows you to integrate specific recycled files without merging entire branches.
.B recycle -b=$USER -cp=<hash_of_commit>

.SH DEFAULT COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT
.TP
The head line defaults to a timestamp in the format:
.B [YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm.ss]

.TP
In all cases, the content paragraph will contain the list of files:
.B /original/file/path/of/first/input.file
.br
.B ...
.br
.B /original/file/path/of/last/input.file

.SH REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
The main branch contains development for the \fBrecycle\fR script itself. Other branches store recycled items for individual users, systems, or purposes.

.SH LICENSES AND SHARING PHILOSOPHY
The \fBrecycle\fR script is licensed under the Artistic License 2.0.
Recycled items are considered public domain unless explicitly stated otherwise.
